<h1>What other people must do to access your files</h1>

A remote peer may access your files by browsing to the URL listed in
the Local Addresses panel (with one exception).  The URL
<tt>http://127.0.0.1:8080/</tt> only works on your own machine.  If a
remote user uses that URL, they will access their own machine, not
yours.

<h2>Private IP addresses</h2>

RFC 1918 [ http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html ] sets aside several
blocks of IP addresses that will not be used on the public internet.
They are: 10.*.*.*, 172.16-31.*.*, and 192.168.*.* .  Many home
firewalls use 192.168.*.* addresses.  If you see that your
LocalAddress is one of these, then you are certainly behind a
masquerading firewall and can not share files with the outside world
without adjusting the firewall's configuration.  However, you can
still share files with other hosts on the same side of the firewall as
you without additional effort.

<h2> firewalls </h2>
If there is a firewall between you and the peer, things get
complicated.

<p> If you can not arrange for the firewall to forward the port,
people outside the firewall will not be able to access your files (it
is the job of firewalls to prevent such access).  

<p> If you <b>can</b> configure the firewall to forward the port (many
commercially available home firewall/routers provide you with a way to
do this), then outside users will be able to access your files.
However, you will have to learn the IP address on the outside of your
firewall and construct your URLs using that.  The firewall conceals
the addresses listed in the Local Addresses panel rendering them
useless to outside peers.

<p>Assuming you have not changed the port you listen on from 8080 to
something else, you can visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to see what your
Flea2Flea share looks like to a browser.  (Remember, that address only
works for you, not your peers).

<h1>How to share a file with the world</h1>

When you start Flea2Flea no files are shared with the world.

<p>A file that you are sharing with the world is known as an Offering.
To add an offering go to the <b>Menu</b> and choose <b>Add
Offerings</b>.

<p> By default the files you select will be shared as
<tt>/<i>basename</i></tt> where <i>basename</i> is calculated by
stripping off all the leading directories.  If you share the local
file <tt>/auto/flash/p0001408.jpg</tt> and your Local Address is
<tt>http://64.233.167.99:8080/</tt>, then your peers can access the
file as <tt>http://64.233.167.99:8080/p0001408.jpg</tt> .

<p> If you would like to change the name you show to the world, go
ahead and edit the URI column in the "Available to downloaders" table.
The URI is not required to have any relation to the name of the file.
You can put many slashes in the URI (e.g. /forwoog/songs/1.mp3)

<h1>How to accept a file from the world</h1>

When you start Flea2Flea peers are not permitted to upload files to
you.  To accept files go to the <b>Menu</b> and choose <b>Add
Uploadable</b> to create an upload slot.

<ul>
<li> You will have to choose a tag.  This is what your peer must type
into the Tag field of the upload section of the Public Index web page.
<li>Then you must choose a destination file.  Do not pick the name of
an existing file because it will be overwritten when someone uploads
to you. <li> The final parameter is the maximum file size.  You can
use this to prevent your peer from filling up your hard drive with
garbage.  You can use suffixes like "k", "m", and "g" for kilobytes,
megabytes, and gigabytes.
</ul>

<p> When one of your peers starts uploading to a slot that slot is
disabled.  This prevents people from overwriting uploads.  If anything
goes wrong with the upload, you can re-activate it from the GUI and
have the peer try again.

<p> It is also possible to designate upload <b>directories</b>.
Instead of choosing a file, choose a directory.  When you set the size
limit, that is actually a restriction on the total number of bytes in
the directory and its subdirectories.  If you set aside 2 gigabytes
and there are already 1.5 gigabytes of files in that directory, then
there are only 0.5 gigabytes available to uploaders.  Upload
directories are <b>not</b> disabled when someone starts uploading.
Therefore it is possible for multiple files to be uploaded without
your intervention.
