<h1>File Sharing scenarios</h1>

<h3>I have a file on one computer and I want to copy it to another
computer</h3>

<h4> Solution 1: </h4>

Run Flea2Flea on the computer that has the file and use the menu to
add that file as an Offering.  Make a note of the URL in your Local
Addresses.  Go to the other computer and use a web browser to download
the file from the URL you memorized.  Do not forget the port number.

<h4> Solution 2: </h4>

Run Flea2Flea on the computer that does not yet have the file.  Use
the menu to add an Uploadable specifying the location to where you
want to upload the file.  Make sure you specify a maximum size that is
big enough to receive all of the file (add a few megabytes, it will
not hurt).  Remember the URL from the Local Addresses panel, as well
as the Tag you gave to the Uploadable.  Go to the computer that has
the file and browse to the Flea2Flea URL of the host that needs the
file.  Use the Upload form to send the file to the host that needs the
file.


<h3> I want to share a file, but I am behind a firewall </h3>

If you can configure the firewall to forward the port to your computer
(most commercially available home router/firewalls have this ability)
you can make it work.  The URLs in the Local Addresses panels will
<b>not</b> be correct from the point of view of a peer out on the
public internet.

<p> Alternatively, have your peer run Flea2Flea and add an Uploadable.
Once he tells you his address and the upload tag, you can use any
modern web browser to upload the file to your peer.

<h3> I want to share a file, but both I and my peer are behind
firewalls </h3>

If you are both behind the same firewall, then it is not a problem,
because the firewall will not be involved in the communication.
<p>Assuming you are behind <b>different</b> firewalls, then at least one
of you will have to configure your firewall for port forwarding and
run Flea2Flea so that the other can upload/download using a web
browser.



<h3> I want to run a web site </h3>

Do not use Flea2Flea.  Use a proper web server like Apache.  Flea2Flea
will not serve files when you are not running the GUI.  Flea2Flea does
not remember shared files between sessions.


<h3> I want to give a file to my friend, but he is not logged in right
now </h3>

You should probably just email it to him.  If his email server can not
handle large files, then you will just have to wait till you are both
logged on and use Flea2Flea.


<h3> I want to share a file anonymously with complete strangers </h3>

While Flea2Flea will not prevent this, it does not really have any way to
publicize that the file is available.  There is no central server or
registry.  You would have to publicize the location through some other
means.  

<p>Also, file sharing only <b>seems</b> anonymous.  For other
computers to download the file, they have to know your internet
address, and if somebody needs to track you down, they can.

<p>
<hr>

<p>Flea2Flea's strength is small-scale ad-hoc file sharing: much like
giving a CD-R to your friend in the office next to yours, except that
you do not have to burn a CD, and the room can be on the other side of
the world.
